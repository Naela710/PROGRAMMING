# Python Discovery Journey

This repository contains various Python scripts that showcase my learning process and experimentation with different aspects of Python. The projects and exercises range from basic Python programming to more advanced machine learning models.

## Projects and Exercises

### 1. Web Scraping Practice
- **Objective**: Training in web scraping techniques using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Selenium.
- **Current Focus**: Preparing for an academic project where I will scrape data from supermarket websites (Auchan and Carrefour) to compare product prices, track promotions, and analyze customer preferences.

### 2. Basic Python Exercises
- Includes basic Python coding exercises to strengthen my understanding of the language and its syntax.

### 3. Machine Learning Models
- Collection of scripts experimenting with different machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and clustering.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **BeautifulSoup & Scrapy**: For web scraping.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning models.

## Future Goals
- Refine the web scraping project for my academic work.
- Explore more advanced machine learning models and integrate them into real-world datasets.
- Apply data visualization techniques to showcase insights from scraped data.

Feel free to explore and provide feedback!
